Bike-sharing viability in Des Moines

## Overview
Spending some time in New York City for a much needed vacation, we determined that the best part of it was being able to take in the sites by renting a bike.  It was easy to pick up and drop off at different points in the city.  This seems to be a good idea to bring back to back home.  This analysis is used to determine if creating a bike-sharing program would be sustainable and profitable in Des Moines, Iowa.  Note that New York City's recorderd population \(2018 census\) is about 8.4 million, while Des Moine's is about 217K \(2018 census\).  Quite a big difference there.\

## Results
For this analysis, we used information from the month of August \(2019\) because there is likely more traffic during the summer months.  As you can see, the weather in both cities are relatively the same this month as well.\

At the highest level, the total number of bike trips in August 2019 is about 2.3 million.  The busiest hours are between 5:00pm and 6:00pm.  This probably due to the afternoon commute time, as well as the best time to be out and about in the city for site-seeing.\

The most popular bike pick-up and drop-off locations are in the heart of the city.  It has the highest volume of people, locals and tourists alike\-\- who either live & work, or site-see there.\

The next two images show the trip duration \(length of time that bikes are checked out\) of riders, then drilled down by gender.  The trip duration ranges from, less than an hour, to a few hours, and even to a full day.  The data also shows that male riders tend to have longer trip durations.\

The following images show the number of bikes checked out by day, per hour.  The data shows that more number of bikes are checked out during the weekdays, as opposed to the weekends.  It also shows that the busiet hours are the morning and afternoon & evening commute hours.\

The last image shows that there are more Subscribers \(long-term\) than Customers \(short-term\) who use the bikes on a given day.  This most likely means, more locals than tourists, use the bike-share program.\

## Summary
NYC Citi Bike is most successful where there is a mixture of locals and tourists.  August is a good month for bike-riding, therefore will need the most number of bikes.  Des Moines is an urban city, which will likely have the same diverse types of people.  The biggest difference is population, therefore the number of bikes needed in the fleet will be significantly less.

I recommend including a pie chart data visualization to show percentage of Gender Type \(female and male\).  This can help with aquiring different size bikes for the fleet, smaller frame for \(most\) females so it's lighter, and a bigger frame for males.  Another visualization I recommend is a pie chart of age range, essentially for the same reason. This will show if it is worth acquiring bikes for kids.
